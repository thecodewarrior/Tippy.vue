features:
  - title: Easy to use
    details: A clumsy tool will wind up chronically underutilized, so Tippy.vue has been designed with a focus on ergonomics.
  - title: Clean to write
    details: Writing Tippy.vue is clean. We don't use wrapper components, everything is in the default slot, and common options are exposed as props.
  - title: Clean HTML
    details: Tippy.vue mounts itself and then disappears from the DOM tree, leaving your layout untouched.
